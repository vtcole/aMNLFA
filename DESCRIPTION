Description: Automated generation, running, and interpretation of moderated
    nonlinear factor analysis models for obtaining scores from observed
    variables. This package creates 'Mplus' input files which may be run iteratively
    to test two different types of covariate effects on items: 
    (1) latent variable impact (both mean and variance); and (2) differential 
    item functioning. After sequentially testing for all effects, it also creates a final
    model by including all significant effects after adjusting for multiple comparisons.
    Finally, the package creates a scoring model which uses the final values of parameter
    estimates to generate latent variable scores.
