Description: Automated generation, running, and interpretation of moderated
    nonlinear factor analysis models for obtaining scores from observed
    variables, using the method described by Gottfredson and colleagues (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.10.031>. 
    This package creates 'Mplus' input files which may be run iteratively
    to test two different types of covariate effects on items: 
    (1) latent variable impact (both mean and variance); and (2) differential 
    item functioning. After sequentially testing for all effects, it also creates a final
    model by including all significant effects after adjusting for multiple comparisons.
    Finally, the package creates a scoring model which uses the final values of parameter
    estimates to generate latent variable scores.
